      "+ Ugh, you're a monster! I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I feel like Godzilla Better hit the deck like the cardzilla My whole squad's in here walking around the party A cross between a zombie apocalypse and b-bomb it up Brain meaning which is probably the same reason I wrestle with mania shades and this bitch I'm posse-ed up Consider it to cross me across the mistake if they sleepin' on me The hoes better get insomnia, ADHD hydroxy cut past the capacity In A-A-A with an AK melee finish at it like a play date Better vacate retreat like a vacay mayday This beat is cray cray ray J-H-A-H-A-H-A-H-A Laughing all the way to the bank I spray flames that cannot tame or placate the monster You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster I'm normal during the day but at night turn to a monster When the moon shines like ice world truckers I look like a villain out of those blockbusters Back to the high spit a monster Blood on the dance floor on the Louis V carpet Fire, bottle of fire I'm just a product of slick cricket onyx Told em nicked the balls had em just appalled Did so many things that pissed em off It's impossible to list em all And in the midst of all this I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball Trying to see what I steal, be like this tomorrow Risperdorf voices whisper my fist is balled back up against the wall Pencil drawn this is just a song to go ballistic on You just blow the pistol on the guy with a missile launcher I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological Quick to tell a bitch to go off like a fifth of vodka When you twist the top of the bottle I'm a monster You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster I'm normal during the day but at night turn to a monster When the moon shines like ice world truckers I look like a villain out of those blockbusters I'ma feed you to the fire spit a monster Blood on the dance floor on the louis v carpet Fire, blood to the fire Blood on the dance floor on the louis v carpet Fire, blood to the fire Blood on the dance floor on the louis v carpet Fire, blood to the fire Blood on the dance floor on the louis v carpet If you never gave a damn Raise your hand, cause I'm about to set trip Vacation plans, one point like my indexes All you will ever get is Some motherfucking finger, finger, prostate exam How can I have all these fans to perspire Like a liar's pants I'm on fire And I got no plans to retire And I'm still the man you admire These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer I got em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers And what goes around comes around Just like the blades on the chainsaw Cause I caught the flag but my dollars stacked right off the bat Like a baseball Like kidding bitch I got them racks with so much ease That they call me Diddy cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk Bitch I'm a player I'm too motherfucking stingy for share Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care But I tell her bitch I'm Mary of Shabaria Face of my genital area The original Richard Ramirez Christian Rivera Cause my lyrics never sit well so they wanna give me the chair Like a paraplegic and it's scary call it Harry Carri Cause every time I'm digging Harry Carri I'm Mary a motherfucking dictionary on them Swearing up and down, they can spit this shit's hilarious It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column We wouldn't see out to eye with a staring problem Get the shaft like a staring column Well that means take a backseat, take it back to fat beats with a maxi Single look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people Is my gangster bitch like Apache with a catchy Jiggle I stack chips you barely gotta half eat, cheat em Filling with the venom and eliminate em Other words I'm in a meat em, I don't wanna hurt em but I did em In a fit of rage I'm murdering again, nobody will evade em Feel like killing em, and dump with their fucking bodies in it like obliterating everything Is in a rate or renegade em, he don't make anybody who want it with a pen and frame Don't nobody want it but they're gonna get it anyway Cause I'm beginning to feel like I'm mentally ill, I'm a telekiller be killed or me killer Be the vanilla gorilla you're bringing the killer within me out of me The enemy of the demon who in at me I be under receiving What stupidity? It'd be every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter When I'm in the vicinity motherfucker you better duck and you finna be dead The minute you run into me a hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent Of me I'm motherfucking finished you bitch I'm unfatable you wanna battle I'm available I'm blown I'm black and inflatable I'm undebatable I'm unavoidable I'm unavoidable I'm on the toilet ball I got a trailer full of money And I'm paid it full I'm not afraid to pull em Man stop, look what I'm planning Man stop, look what I'm planning\n"
